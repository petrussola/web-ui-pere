# web-ui-pere

Welcome to my first build week project: I'll serve soup. This is a "simple" HTML and CSS page that hopefully displays everything I have learnt so far. Feedback welcome.

- Clone repo
- Run `npm install`
- To fire server `npm run server`
- To compile the less `npm run less`

this is a test branch
